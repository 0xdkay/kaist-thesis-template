Long Term Evolution (LTE) is becoming the dominant cellular networking
technology, shifting the cellular network away from its circuit-switched legacy
towards a packet-switched network that resembles the Internet. To support voice
calls over the LTE network, operators have introduced Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE),
which dramatically changes how voice calls are handled, both from user equipment
and infrastructure perspectives. We find that this dramatic shift opens up a
number of new attack surfaces that have not been previously explored. To call
attention to this matter, this paper presents a systematic security analysis.
