\section{Motivation}

% popular \vt
Due to the increasing demand for data-centric services,
mobile network operators are quickly moving towards high-speed networks.


\section{Research Direction and Contribution}
In this paper, we first present problems of
commercially deployed VoLTE services

To summarize, we make the three following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
\item To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt
\item To show the motivation for addressing these problems, 
\item We proposed effective, immediate countermeasures,
\end{itemize}

\section{Thesis Structure}
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. ~\autoref{sec:back} presents an
overview of the VoLTE system with the network architecture and call setup procedure
including the accounting policy of real operators.  In~\autoref{sec:anal}, we bring
up current problems and threats of deployed VoLTE services through an analysis
of VoLTE call flow.  We explain the details of hidden data channel attacks and
implementation details along with the measurement results in
\autoref{sec:accounting}. ~\autoref{sec:attack} introduces possible attacks
caused by several implementation flaws in the VoLTE service.  In~\autoref{sec:cm},
we provide countermeasures of our attacks and discuss immediate and
fundamental solutions. ~\autoref{sec:rel} includes related work, and we
conclude our study and present directions for future work in~\autoref{sec:concl}.
